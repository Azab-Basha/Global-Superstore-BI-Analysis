### Summary & Objective

This project delivers a comprehensive Power BI analysis of Global Superstore's multi-year performance, focusing on two critical areas: *Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)* and *Product Portfolio Profitability. The primary objective was to move beyond descriptive reporting to provide prescriptive, actionable insights that **reduce profit leakage* (through high churn and destructive discounting) and *optimize high-value customer retention*.

### Key Business Questions Answered

The analysis was designed to address core business challenges across the customer journey and product lifecycle:

1.  What is the final *Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), and what percentage of our customer base constitutes **lifetime churn*?
2.  How does retention evolve for established *customer cohorts* over multiple years, and where is the steepest drop-off?
3.  Which products are the absolute *Best and Poorest Performers* when simultaneously weighted across *Sales, Profit, and Returns*?
4.  Which *Discount Bands (e.g., 40%+)* lead to the most significant *profit erosion* versus sales gain across different regions?
5.  What is the financial breakdown of sales and profit across our tiered *Customer Classes (Titanium, Platinum, Gold, and Silver)*?
6.  How do the return rates of our most profitable products compare to the average, indicating potential quality or logistics risks?
7.  Which major product categories (*Technology, Furniture, and office supplies) offer the highest and lowest **profit contribution*, informing inventory strategy?
8.  How does the 3-Month Rolling Average of Total Profit compare to the Total Sales trend, indicating potential long-term pricing and discounting issues?
9. ​ Which customer segments (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office) are responsible for the highest Return Rates, informing targeted post-sale support strategies?
10. Which geographic markets (countries) are the highest and lowest performers in terms of absolute sales and profit margin percentage?
11. What is the relationship between Average Shipping Days and Average Profit per Order, helping to determine the optimal balance between cost and delivery speed?

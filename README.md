### 🎯 Summary & Objective

This project delivers a comprehensive Power BI analysis of Global Superstore's multi-year performance, focusing on two critical areas: *Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)* and *Product Portfolio Profitability. The primary objective was to move beyond descriptive reporting to provide prescriptive, actionable insights that **reduce profit leakage* (through high churn and destructive discounting) and *optimize high-value customer retention*.

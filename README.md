## Summary & Objective

This project delivers a comprehensive Power BI analysis of Global Superstore's multi-year performance, focusing on two critical areas: **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** and **Product Portfolio Profitability**. The primary objective was to move beyond descriptive reporting to provide prescriptive, actionable insights that **reduce profit leakage** (through high churn and destructive discounting) and **optimize high-value customer retention**.
## Dataset Used 
- <a href="https://github.com/Azab-Basha/Global-Superstore-BI-Analysis/blob/main/Globa_Superstore.xlsx">Global Superstore Dataset</a>
## Key Business Questions Answered

The analysis was designed to address core business challenges across the customer journey and product lifecycle:

1.  What is the final **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**, and what percentage of our customer base constitutes **lifetime churn**?
2.  How does retention evolve for established **customer cohorts** over multiple years, and where is the steepest drop-off?
3.  Which products are the absolute **Best and Poorest Performers** when simultaneously weighted across **Sales, Profit**, and **Returns**?
4.  Which **Discount Bands (e.g., 40%+)** lead to the most significant **profit erosion** versus sales gain across different regions?
5.  What is the financial breakdown of sales and profit across our tiered **Customer Classes (Titanium, Platinum, Gold, and Silver)**?
6.  How do the return rates of our most profitable products compare to the average, indicating potential quality or logistics risks?
7.  Which major product categories **(Technology, Furniture, and office supplies)** offer the highest and lowest **profit contribution**, informing inventory strategy?
8.  How does the 3-Month Rolling Average of Total Profit compare to the Total Sales trend, indicating potential long-term pricing and discounting issues?
9. ​ Which customer segments **(Consumer, Corporate, Home Office)** are responsible for the highest Return Rates, informing targeted post-sale support strategies?
10. Which **geographic markets (countries)** are the highest and lowest performers in terms of absolute sales and profit margin percentage?
11. What is the relationship between **Average Shipping Days** and **Average Profit** per Order, helping to determine the optimal balance between cost and delivery speed?

## Key Findings and Insights

1. **Geographic Performance Disparity**  
   Asia Pacific recorded the highest Total Sales at **4,042,658** significantly outperforming Africa, which had the lowest at **783,773**.

2. **Recent Growth Trigger**  
   The **Rolling Avg 3M** showed a strong upward trend starting **August 19, 2015**, increasing by **38.98%** over **4.40 months**, indicating a strong but unidentified growth catalyst.

3. **Sales Volume Driver**  
   The **0–10% discount band** contributed the majority of Total Sales **7,375,423** or **(58.34%)**, far surpassing the **30–40% band**, which generated only **330,749**.

4. **Regional Profit Erosion**  
   Higher discount ranges (**30–40%** and **40%**) significantly eroded profit and sales, especially in **Australia, Turkey, and France**.

5. **Segmented Return Risk**  
   The *Consumer* segment had the highest Return Rate **(6.51%)**, followed by **Corporate (5.75%)** and *Home Office **(5.49%)**.

6. **Customer Class Value**  
   The **Titanium** class generated the highest Total Sales and Total Profit.  
   The **Silver** class generated the lowest.  
   Top individual performers:  
   - **Tom Ashbrook** – Total Sales: **30,968.13**  
   - **Raymond Buch** – Total Profit: **8,226.72**

7. **Critical Profit Leak**  
   The **(74.63%)** **Lifetime Customer Churn Rate** poses a major threat to profitability, offsetting the strong potential of the **$972.65** **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**.

8. **Category Sales Dominance**  
   **Technology** led with **4,744,557** in Total Sales, outperforming **Office Supplies** by **(25.27%)** (Office Supplies: **3,787,492**.

9. **Category Profit Efficiency** 
   **Technology** generated **45%** of all profit, followed by *Office Supplies **(35%)**, while **Furniture** contributed the least at **19%**.


 ## Final Recommendations

1.  *Strategic Resource Shift:** Shift marketing and sales resources away from low-performing regions like **Africa** and redirect them toward **Asia Pacific** to capitalize on proven market demand.
2.  **Growth Catalyst Replication:** Immediately investigate sales and marketing activities that occurred just prior to **August 19, 2015**, to codify and replicate this successful growth catalyst.
3.  **Discount Band Optimization:** Maintain the high-volume **0-10% discount band**. Re-evaluate the effectiveness of the low-volume **30-40% band**; consider eliminating it or shifting sales to the more profitable **10-20% range**.
4.  **Regional Discount Policy:** Establish and enforce a regional policy that **strictly curtails deep discounts (above 30%)** in markets like **Australia, Turkey, and France**, where they are shown to be unprofitable.
5.  **Segment-Specific Support:** Implement targeted post-sale support and product education specifically for the **Consumer segment** to reduce their high return rate of **(6.51%)**.
6.  **Customer Class Investment:** Prioritize marketing spend and VIP service on the top-tier **Titanium** class. Create a remediation or sunset plan for the low-performing **Silver** class to stop resource drain.
7.  **Retention Program Launch:** Launch a focused campaign within **90 days** of the first purchase to drive a second sale and actively reduce the high **74.63% lifetime churn rate**.
8.  **Technology Inventory Scale:** Allocate greater capital and warehousing space to **Technology** inventory to meet its high sales demand, ensuring supply chains can sustain its dominance.
9.  **Furniture Profit Deep-Dive:** Conduct a deep-dive analysis into the **Furniture** category to identify the source of its low **(19% )** profit contribution and develop an efficiency plan.

## Important Note on DAX Methodology
The DAX measures documented below represent the unique logical structure (the core pattern) used in the project. Many of these measures have been replicated across different dimensions (e.g., Pareto analysis applied to both Customers and Products) and used multiple times with minor changes to the base measure. This methodological approach ensures code efficiency, reduces redundancy, and demonstrates scalability across the entire semantic model.

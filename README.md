### Summary & Objective

This project delivers a comprehensive Power BI analysis of Global Superstore's multi-year performance, focusing on two critical areas: **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** and **Product Portfolio Profitability**. The primary objective was to move beyond descriptive reporting to provide prescriptive, actionable insights that **reduce profit leakage** (through high churn and destructive discounting) and **optimize high-value customer retention**.
## Dataset Used 
- <a href="https://github.com/Azab-Basha/Global-Superstore-BI-Analysis/blob/main/Globa_Superstore.xlsx">Global Superstore Dataset</a>
## Key Business Questions Answered

The analysis was designed to address core business challenges across the customer journey and product lifecycle:

1.  What is the final **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**, and what percentage of our customer base constitutes **lifetime churn**?
2.  How does retention evolve for established **customer cohorts** over multiple years, and where is the steepest drop-off?
3.  Which products are the absolute **Best and Poorest Performers** when simultaneously weighted across **Sales, Profit**, and **Returns**?
4.  Which **Discount Bands (e.g., 40%+)** lead to the most significant **profit erosion** versus sales gain across different regions?
5.  What is the financial breakdown of sales and profit across our tiered **Customer Classes (Titanium, Platinum, Gold, and Silver)**?
6.  How do the return rates of our most profitable products compare to the average, indicating potential quality or logistics risks?
7.  Which major product categories **(Technology, Furniture, and office supplies)** offer the highest and lowest **profit contribution**, informing inventory strategy?
8.  How does the 3-Month Rolling Average of Total Profit compare to the Total Sales trend, indicating potential long-term pricing and discounting issues?
9. ​ Which customer segments **(Consumer, Corporate, Home Office)** are responsible for the highest Return Rates, informing targeted post-sale support strategies?
10. Which **geographic markets (countries)** are the highest and lowest performers in terms of absolute sales and profit margin percentage?
11. What is the relationship between **Average Shipping Days** and **Average Profit** per Order, helping to determine the optimal balance between cost and delivery speed?

 Final Recommendations

1.  *Strategic Resource Shift:** Shift marketing and sales resources away from low-performing regions like **Africa** and redirect them toward **Asia Pacific** to capitalize on proven market demand.

3.  **Discount Band Optimization:** Maintain the high-volume **0-10% discount band**. Re-evaluate the effectiveness of the low-volume **30-40% band**; consider eliminating it or shifting sales to the more profitable **10-20% range**.
4.  **Regional Discount Policy:** Establish and enforce a regional policy that **strictly curtails deep discounts (above 30%)** in markets like **Australia, Turkey, and France**, where they are shown to be unprofitable.
5.  **Segment-Specific Support:** Implement targeted post-sale support and product education specifically for the **Consumer segment** to reduce their high return rate of **(6.51%)**.
6.  **Customer Class Investment:** Prioritize marketing spend and VIP service on the top-tier **Titanium** class. Create a remediation or sunset plan for the low-performing **Silver** class to stop resource drain.
